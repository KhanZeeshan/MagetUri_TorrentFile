MagetUri_TorrentFile
====================

Download Torrent File From Magnet Uri


As the name suggets its a simple desktop app that takes "Magnet-Uri" as input & download the "Torrent" file associated with it. I created this because I use multiple PC & I hate searching for same TORRENT file multiple times, thats why I created this.

For the time being I have done everything on Main-Thread, but in future I would love to add download progress bar & download %age label also download speed label.

If you guys think you can make a lot better & efficient then please be my guest.
